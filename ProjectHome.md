The SPMP305x is an ARM926EJ-s processor by Sunplus. No datasheet for it was ever released, so all the data in this project was found by reverse engineering the existing firmwares.

The goal of the project is to create a library for use with the SPMP305x series of processors, enabling the usage of other operating systems.
