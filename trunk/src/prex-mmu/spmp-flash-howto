Ok with the latest nand.c, this works for me:

  create an AR archive:

     ar rcS flashimg.a ./usr/sample/lrzsz/lrz  (and a bunch of other files)
     
  boot the device with original firmware, assuming it maps to /dev/sde

    cat flashimg.a /dev/zero > /dev/sde

  break after you feel you have enough padding (hah, yeah, about 15 seconds i guess.. we really need to figure out how to sync)

    then reboot the device in prex and run:

    mount /dev/nand_user /mnt/floppy arfs

et voila, a working /mnt/floppy with the files you just put there!
