No fancy instruction file, nobody will read it anyway ;)


GOAL
----

Basically, there is no goal except for "get as many points as possible".
The further you can pilot your helicopter through the cave, the more
points you'll get. Beat your own highscore! Avoid hitting the rocks for
high score! ;)

CONTROLS
--------

One button control, press A for thrust.
You might reset the game with L+R+START+SELECT.

GAME MODES
----------

Something slightly innovative: Cave Copter has 3 different game modes
with 4 speeds each:

* Normal mode - Avoid the blocks
* Coin mode - Avoid the blocks, collect coins for additional points
* Moving mode - Avoid the moving blocks

Note: lower speeds don't necessarily mean easier gameplay - slow moving mode
can be pretty challenging.

In all of those 3 game modes, the cave gets slightly narrower from time to
time.
